# Use this file for writing helper functions that can be used throughout the project.
# If this file grows too large or disorganized, it may be helpful to break it up into multiple files, like date_helpers, string_helpers, etc.

"""
Examples of Helper Functions:
- Convert datetime objects to user readable formats or specific timezones.
- Format currency, percentages, or other numerical data.
- Template filters (be sure to not duplicate Django's preexisting and vast libraries here, though).
- Image resizing
